    <h2>Tornado</h2>
    <p>Tornadoes can destroy buildings, flip cars, and create deadly flying debris. Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes can:
Happen anytime and anywhere;
Bring intense winds, over 200 MPH; and
Look like funnels.</p>
    <h3>IF YOU ARE UNDER A TORNADO WARNING, FIND SAFE SHELTER RIGHT AWAY</h3>
    <ol type="I"></ol>
    <li>if you can safely get to a sturdy building, then do so immediately.</li>
    <li>Go to a safe room, basement, or storm cellar.</li>
    <li>If you are in a building with no basement, then get to a small interior room on the lowest level.</li>
    <li>Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls.</li>
    <li>Do not get under an overpass or bridge. Youâ€™re safer in a low, flat location.</li>
   <li> Watch out for flying debris that can cause injury or death.</li>
    <li>Use your arms to protect your head and neck.</li>

<h2>Tsunami</h2>

    <p>Travel 20-30 miles per hour with waves 10-100 feet high.</p>
    <p>Cause flooding and disrupt transportation, power, communications, and the water supply.</p>
    <p>Happen anywhere along U.S. coasts.</p>
    <p>Coasts that border the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean have the greatest risk.</p>
